    Then the launch id should equal saved id
    And the launch mission name should be defined

    When I fetch launches with limit 1
    And I save the first launch id
    And I login with email "test@example.com"
    And I book trip for saved launch
    Then the booking should be successful

  Scenario: Apollo - User login mutation
    When I login with email "test@example.com"
    Then the login result should contain id and token and email "test@example.com"
